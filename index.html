    <h1>Hello World! (again)</h1>
    <h2>Here are a few (more) things about me.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is Kevin Vazquez-Vega.</li>
      <li>My hobbies have not changed the last time I took a course akin to this.</li>
      <li>I have hit the 2000 hour mark in Terraria (woo.)</li>
      <li>I have added purple to my little color scheme. I might employ it in these next projects instead of just grayscale and red.</li>
    </ul>
